- **Smooth Animations**: Modern fade-in/zoom effects

### 2. **Intelligent Feedback Logic** (`useFeedback.ts` hook)
- **Smart Timing**: Only shows after 30 seconds of session time
- **Random Triggering**: 30% chance to show feedback (configurable)

## 🎨 User Experience Flow

### 1. **First-time User Journey**
```
User visits → Analyzes essay → Views results → 5 sec delay → Feedback modal appears (30% chance)
```

### 2. **Feedback Modal Experience**
```
Stars appear → User clicks rating → Detail form shows → User submits → Success message → Auto-close
```

### 3. **Smart Persistence**
```
User dismisses → Cooldown starts → Won't show again for 7 days → Max 3 dismissals total
```

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Timing Settings (in `useFeedback.ts`)
```typescript
const FEEDBACK_COOLDOWN = 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000  // 7 days
const MAX_DISMISSALS = 3                             // Maximum dismissals
const MIN_SESSION_TIME = 30000                       // 30 seconds
const FEEDBACK_CHANCE = 0.3                          // 30% trigger chance
```

### Trigger Methods
```typescript
// Force show feedback (for testing)
triggerFeedbackCheck(true)

// Smart trigger (with probability)
triggerOnResultView()    // After viewing results
triggerOnFeatureUse()    // After using features
triggerOnPageLeave()     // On exit intent
```
